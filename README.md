FreshCart – Modern Grocery Shopping UI

FreshCart is a clean, modern, and responsive grocery-store web interface built using React, TypeScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS with shadcn-ui components.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate an intuitive shopping experience with product browsing, deals and offers, category filtering, and a visually engaging layout suitable for real-world grocery e-commerce applications.

This repository currently contains the frontend only. It can be connected to any backend API (Node.js, Firebase, json-server, etc.) depending on your needs.

🗄 Database / Backend Integration

This project does not include a backend.
You can connect any database or API. Some common approaches:

Option A – Mock API (json-server)

Quick and easy for development.

Option B – Firebase Firestore

Great for hosted serverless backend and authentication.

Option C – Node.js + Express + MongoDB / PostgreSQL

Ideal for full production systems.

If you want, I can generate the backend folder structure and API templates for you.
